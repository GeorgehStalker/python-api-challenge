The project is designed to leverage data analytics for exploring weather patterns and planning vacations based on ideal weather conditions. It is structured into two main parts:

WeatherPy: This component focuses on analyzing weather data to understand how weather changes as one moves closer to the equator. The goal is to create visualizations that clearly depict these patterns, helping to answer the question, "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

VacationPy: Building on the insights from WeatherPy, this part aims to use the analyzed weather data to plan vacations. It involves identifying locations with favorable weather conditions, creating maps and other visual tools to assist users in choosing ideal vacation spots based on their weather preferences.

Through these two components, the project aims to provide a comprehensive tool for both understanding weather trends and making informed decisions about vacation planning.
